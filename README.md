# Summer Student Project 2025

## Project Description 
> This project will focus on comparing sensitivity thresholds, noise characteristics, detector response, and background rates between real and simulated ProtoDUNE-HD data, focusing particularly on Argon-39. The student will have an opportunity to gain insights into the detection principles of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers and develop key skills in data handling, statistical analysis, and simulation techniques using programming languages such as C++, Python, and ROOT to carry out their analyses and simulations.

## Detector Geometry

The ProtoDUNE-HD detector comprises a 8.5 x 7.9 x 8.5 m^3 cryostat. The cryostat is spanned by alternating arrays of high-voltage cathode and low-voltage anode planes, where each anode-cathode pair defines a single LArTPC drift volume (with a drift length of 3.6 m.). The detector volume is filled with liquid argon, which serves as the active target medium for particle interactions. 
The PDHD detector includes four APAs arranged in two rows on either side of the beamline, creating four LArTPC drift volumes. Each APA has four wire planes on both sides, totaling 2,560 active channels: one collection plane with 960 vertical wires per side, and two induction planes with 800 angled wires per plane that wrap around both sides of the APA.
In line with the usual DUNE convention, the coordinate system is defined in such a way that the z-axis is alinged with the beam direction, x-axis is algined with the drift direciton, and y-axis is aligned with the vertical (upwards) direction.
